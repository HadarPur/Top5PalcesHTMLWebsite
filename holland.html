                        Holland is a region and former province on the western coast of the Netherlands. 
                        The name Holland is also frequently used informally to refer to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. 
                        This usage is commonly accepted in other countries, and sometimes employed by the Dutch themselves. However, some in the Netherlands, particularly those 
                        from regions outside Holland, may find it undesirable or misrepresentative to use the term for the whole country.
                        From the 10th to the 16th century, Holland proper was a unified political region within the Holy Roman Empire as a county ruled by the Counts of Holland. 
                        By the 17th century, the province of Holland had risen to become a maritime and economic power, dominating the other provinces of the newly independent Dutch Republic.
                        The area of the former County of Holland roughly coincides with the two current Dutch provinces of North Holland and South Holland in which it was divided, 
                        which together include the Netherlands' three largest cities: the de jure capital city of Amsterdam; Rotterdam, home of Europe's largest port; and the seat of government of The Hague.
