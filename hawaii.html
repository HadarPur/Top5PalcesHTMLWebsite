                        Hawaii is the 50th and most recent state to have joined the United States, having received statehood on August 21, 1959. 
                        Hawaii is the only U.S. state located in Oceania, the only U.S. state located outside North America, and the only one composed entirely of islands. 
                        It is the northernmost island group in Polynesia, occupying most of an archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean.
                        The state encompasses nearly the entire volcanic Hawaiian archipelago, which comprises hundreds of islands spread over 1,500 miles (2,400 km). 
                        At the southeastern end of the archipelago, the eight main islands are—in order from northwest to southeast: Niʻihau, Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, Kahoʻolawe, Maui, and the Island of Hawaiʻi. 
                        The last is the largest island in the group; it is often called the "Big Island" or "Hawaiʻi Island" to avoid confusion with the state or archipelago. 
                        The archipelago is physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania.
                        Hawaii's diverse natural scenery, warm tropical climate, abundance of public beaches, oceanic surroundings, and active volcanoes make it a popular destination for tourists, surfers, biologists, and volcanologists. 
                        Because of its central location in the Pacific and 19th-century labor migration, Hawaii's culture is strongly influenced by North American and East Asian cultures, in addition to its indigenous Hawaiian culture. 
                        Hawaii has over a million permanent residents, along with many visitors and U.S. military personnel. 
                        Its capital is Honolulu on the island of Oʻahu.
                        Hawaii is the 8th-smallest and the 11th-least populous, but the 13th-most densely populated of the 50 U.S. 
                        states. It is the only state with an Asianplurality. The state's oceanic coastline is about 750 miles (1,210 km) long, the fourth longest in the U.S. after the coastlines of Alaska, Florida, and California.
